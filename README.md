> [!NOTE]
>
> My Dream Factory is a simple game prototype that I made just to test my coding skills. And the gameplay is very short. You may find bugs in the game and so on and so forth, I would appreciate it if you don't worry too much about them.
>
> I didn't have time for responsive design, so I had the AI do it. There may be problems, don't worry too much. :p
>
> By the way, if you refresh the page, all your progress will be lost :) I'm just saying.
